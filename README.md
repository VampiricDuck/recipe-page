### What I learned

Throughout this project I've encountered a number of hurdles to overcome. For HTML, I learned how to properly make a table using tr and td tags to designate what lines go in each row, and what lines are the data that go into said row. CSS I’ve had a number of troubles, but I did how to properly incorporate fonts by first linking them in the html fine then using them. Learning div structures has also been a quick reminder, while the basic concept had been acquired i was still getting stuck, and so google I did and quickly came to the conclusion that divs are like boxed, literally. The last thing I truly learned was styling a table. Having to class specific data and highlighting the bottom border of the cells. 

### Continued development

I want to continue to learn better ways to sort my HTML, and of course learning more css.

### Useful resources
